## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/COTS.git
   cd COTS
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote** (to sync with main repo):
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/COTSCLI/COTS.git
   ```

**Note:** You will work on your fork and submit Pull Requests. You must not push directly to the upstream repository.

### Fork-only PR policy

- Open PRs from your fork (`origin`) only; do not push any branches to `upstream`.
- Direct pushes to `upstream` are restricted to maintainers and automation.
- Keep your fork up to date and base your feature branches on the latest `upstream/main`.

Recommended safety guard to prevent accidental upstream pushes:

```bash
# Make upstream fetch-only locally
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
# Verify: upstream should have no push URL
git remote -v
```

Sync your fork with upstream before starting work:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
git push origin main
```

Create a feature branch on your fork and push to your fork:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
# ...do work...
git push -u origin feature/your-feature
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **GHC**: 9.4.8 or later
- **Stack**: Latest version
- **SQLite3**: For database functionality
- **Git**: For version control

### Building the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies and build
stack build

# Run tests
stack test

# Run with coverage
stack test --coverage

# Generate documentation
stack haddock
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run the CLI
stack exec cotscli -- --help

# Or install locally
stack install
cotscli --help
```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in the codebase
- **Features**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Examples**: Add usage examples
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality

## Coding Standards

### Haskell Style Guide

- Follow standard Haskell style conventions
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length: **100 characters**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type signatures for all top-level functions
- Document complex functions with comments

### Code Quality Tools

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Run HLint for style suggestions
stack install hlint
hlint src/ app/ test/

# Format code (optional, but recommended)
stack install ormolu
ormolu --mode inplace $(find . -name '*.hs')
```

### Module Organization

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE ... #-}  -- Language extensions at top

-- |
-- Module documentation here
module MyModule
  ( exportedFunction1
  , exportedFunction2
  ) where

-- Standard library imports
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.Text as T

-- Third-party imports
import Database.SQLite.Simple

-- Local imports
import COTS.Types
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- All new features **must** include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for **70%+ code coverage** for new code
- Use descriptive test names

### Test Structure

```haskell
describe "Feature Name" $ do
  it "should do something specific" $ do
    -- Arrange
    let input = ...
    
    -- Act
    result <- someFunction input
    
    -- Assert
    result `shouldBe` expected
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
stack test

# Run specific test suite
stack test cardano-offline-transaction-simulator:test:cardano-offline-transaction-simulator-test

# Run with verbose output
stack test --test-arguments="--verbose"

# Run with coverage
stack test --coverage

# View coverage report
stack hpc report --all
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
